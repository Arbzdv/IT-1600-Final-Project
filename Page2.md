# Adobe Photoshop Keybinds 


##### What is a Keybind?
A keybind is a series of one or several keys that invoke a software program to perform a preprogrammed action. 

##### Why are these Important?
In Adobe Photoshop keybinds are an essential. These short combinations of keys, which is different on Mac and Windows, will save you quite a lot of time while you work on project in Photoshop. There are so many tools to use in Photoshop, most of them can be found through the GUI at the top of the screen and on the left and right sides of your work area. The work area is the space on the screen where your work is being displayed. Around the work area there are banners and boxes that contain a majority of the brushes and other photoshop tools. We will go more in depth about those tools on Page 3. 

By using Keyboard shortcuts, users increase productivity by saving users time while they work. In Adobe Photoshop there is quite a lot of use of the mouse and in some cases you would rather use your keyboard to quickly apply a change, rather than having to move your mouse around and find the save button for example. It is important to know these commands to save yourself time and to help protect your work from accidental mistakes. 

##### What is a Cheat Sheet? 

A cheet sheet is sometimes something that College Professors allow on exams with extensive information that is hard to cram into memory. In the tech world these often are tables rather than being word soup in .6 font on a note card. These tables may contain syntax for languages, syntax conversion, and in our case keybindings! These are extremely helpful when you start out with any program and can be a huge time saver. Below I created a basic table with the introductory keybinds. A link to a compleley full cheat sheet can be found [here](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/photoshop-mac/cheatsheet).
